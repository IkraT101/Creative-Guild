<p> *cough* cue powerful narrator voice: </p>
<p>â€œJoin us on an adventure of a lifetime, to a world unknown, filled with creatures hiding in their rooms, coming out to see the light once in a blue moon, to interact in the unknown.
All are invited! Whether your stories are simply just ideas or all you have is a character in mind, to those who write as they breath, to intricate planners of nonsense!
Whether you like action, romance, or revision of old classics and new (yes fan fiction writers! I am the point at you hissing behind your bright screens! Its time to see the light) Come and explore it all!
Find a home away from home at Keele Creative writing society! </p>
